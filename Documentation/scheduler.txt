This is a Round-Robin scheduler.

In this case, "autoSelected" picks the the routine that will be performed in a particuklare autonomous mode.

This is much more versatile than that.

The "else" clauses can be removed so that all "if"s can be executed during each loop.  

In this way, any of the branches can be executed during each execution of the loop.








	void AutonomousPeriodic() {
		if (flag1 == TRUE) {taskOne();}
		if (flag2 == TRUE) {taskTwo();}
		if (flaG3 == autonNameRed3) {taskThree();}
		if (Flag4 == autonNameBlue1) {taskFour(); }
		if (flag5 == autonNameBlue2) {taskFive(); }
		else
			stopMotors();

		//SmartDashboardUpdate();
	}
