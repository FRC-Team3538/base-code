Thins to do:

LED controller with Arduino Nano:
1. Get the lights to work (1 nano digital output)
2. RoboRio sends commands to the Nano. (1 nano digital input, 1 RoboRio PWM output)
3. Combine them
	Nano: 1 digital input, 1 digital output
	RoboRio: 1 PWM output

Make the sensor turret work.
1. Construct the prototype turret
2. Control the servo
	Test: 
		Set to -185, -180, -135, -90, -45, 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 185 degrees.
		Pause 1000 ms at each angle.
			

3. Add the stop switches, recalibrate at endpoints
	Test: 
		Set the servo to +270 degrees. 
			It stops at the + stop.
		Set the servo to 0 degees. 
			It stops at -90 degees
		Set the servo to -270 degrees. 
			It stops at the - stop.
		Set the servo to 0 degees. 
			It stops at +90 degees.

4. Add hysteresis.
	Test:
		Increase the angle (in 4 degree steps) from +170 to +270. Pause 200 ms between values. (takes 5 sec.)
			At +185 degrees it rolls over to -175 and increases, stopping at -90.
		Increase the angle (in 45 degree steps) from +100 to +280.  Pause 2000 ms between values. (takes 8 sec.)
			It turns around without going all of the way to the end, stopping at -80.
		Decrease the angle (in 4 degree steps) from -170 to -270. Pause 200 ms between values. (takes 5 sec.)
			At -185 degrees it rolls over to +175 and increases, stopping at +90.
		Decrease the angle (in 45 degree steps) from -100 to -280.  Pause 2000 ms between values. (takes 8 sec.)
			It turns around without going all of the way to the end, stopping at +80.

5. Add gyroscope.
	Test:
		Set the gyroscope angle.  Move the base.
			It keeps pointing in the same direction.

6. Add simulated vision input
	Test:
		adjust the vision input
			It keeps pointing in the same direction with adjustments from the vision input.

Arduino I/O:
	1. 1 PWM output (servo control to RoboRio, due to rules)
	3. 1 digital input (PWM, requested angle)
RoboRio I/O:
	1. 1 PWM output (requested angle)
	3. 1 digital input (PWM, servo control, due to rules)
	4. 1 PWM output (servo motor control, due to rules)
	
	(RoboRio can adjust the motors until servo control is at zero.)
